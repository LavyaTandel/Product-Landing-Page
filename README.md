Image Editing Considerations
For your product landing page, you'll need to prepare several images:

Logo: Create a simple, memorable logo for your product.
Feature icons: Simple icons to represent each feature (included as placeholders in the code).
Product image: For the benefits section (included as a placeholder).
Testimonial author photos: Small headshots for testimonials (included as placeholders).

Basic Image Editing Tips:

Cropping Images:

Crop images to maintain a consistent aspect ratio
For product shots, ensure the product is the focal point
For testimonial photos, crop to a square aspect ratio for the circular display


Image Optimization:

Compress images to reduce file size (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
Save in appropriate formats: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, SVG for icons and logos
Use consistent dimensions for similar elements (all feature icons same size, etc.)


Design Templates:

You can use design tools like Canva, Figma, or Adobe XD to create consistent image templates
Create a style guide with your brand colors, fonts, and image styles
Use templates for feature icons to maintain visual consistency
